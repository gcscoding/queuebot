* Added the !auto feature. Usage:

  !auto <off|N D> 
  
  where 'off' stops the bot from automatically printing several
  messages from the queue. N and D are the number of messages to print and the
  interval at which to print them (in seconds), respectively.
  
  For example, !auto 5 30 would have the bot attempt to print out 5 messages
  every 30 seconds. MESSAGE QUEUE IS EMPTY messages are not generated by the
  !auto command; the bot simply will not print anything.

* Added the QueueBot.ini file, which allows for easier customization of the
  bot's settings. The file should be located in the same directory as the
  executable used to start the bot.

* Changed the bot's framework to use the Pirc framework. All previous 
  functionality has been preserved.

* Changed the bot to receive parameters from arguments in the batch file rather
  than from a .INI file. This seemed to provide better usability and the
  ability to mor easily spawn multiple bots.
